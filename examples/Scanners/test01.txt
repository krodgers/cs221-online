Moth in the machine: Debugging the origins of 'bug'

Word nerds trace the word bug to an old term for a monster -- it's a
word that has survived in obscure terms like bugaboo and bugbear and
in a mangled form in the word boogeyman. Like gremlins in machinery,
system bugs are malicious. Anyone who spends time trying to get all
the faults out of a system knows how it feels: After a few hours of
debugging, any problems that remain are hellspawn, mocking attempts to
get rid of them with a devilish glee.

And that's the real origin of the term "bug." But we think the tale of
the moth in the relay is worth retelling anyway.
